Em           D5  Em
Hollow lines
Em                          D5    Em
Chalk the wall of fate with empty signs
In the dark the hate is coming to life
Scorn and shame are getting alive
Scorn and shame getting alive

H7         Em         G
The rising sun as his loan
       Em          H7
On the meadow all alone
           Em            G
Not always winner of the race
         Em           E7
Safe and lonely magic place
